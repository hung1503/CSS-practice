## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

After the practice, I learned more about CSS porperties and get used to styling the components.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="container">
  <img class="qrCode" src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QRCode" />
  <div class="title">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</div>
  <div class="description">
    Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skill to the
    next level
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  background-color: white;
  margin-top: 200px;
  padding: 15px 15px 22px;
  width: 250px;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  border-radius: 15px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  box-shadow: 4px 4px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to practice my styling with CSS and HTML more in the future. I want to get familiar with the CSS properties and how to use them effectively.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&list=WL&index=2&t=23364s) - This helped me to recall all the basic of HTML&CSS.
